[**Changelog**](https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI/blob/main/docs/Changelog_EN.md) | [**FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)**](https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI/wiki/FAQ-(Frequently-Asked-Questions)) 

Realtime Voice Conversion Software using RVC : [w-okada/voice-changer](https://github.com/w-okada/voice-changer)


> The dataset for the pre-training model uses nearly 50 hours of high quality VCTK open source dataset.

> High quality licensed song datasets will be added to training-set one after another for your use, without worrying about copyright infringement.

> Please look forward to the pretrained base model of RVCv3, which has larger parameters, more training data, better results, unchanged inference speed, and requires less training data for training.

## Summary
This repository has the following features:
+ Reduce tone leakage by replacing the source feature to training-set feature using top1 retrieval;
+ Easy and fast training, even on relatively poor graphics cards;
+ Training with a small amount of data also obtains relatively good results (>=10min low noise speech recommended);
+ Supporting model fusion to change timbres (using ckpt processing tab->ckpt merge);
+ Easy-to-use Webui interface;
+ Use the UVR5 model to quickly separate vocals and instruments.
+ Use the most powerful High-pitch Voice Extraction Algorithm [InterSpeech2023-RMVPE](#Credits) to prevent the muted sound problem. Provides the best results (significantly) and is faster, with even lower resource consumption than Crepe_full.
+ AMD/Intel graphics cards acceleration supported.
+ Intel ARC graphics cards acceleration with IPEX supported.

## Preparing the environment
The following commands need to be executed in the environment of Python version 3.8 or higher.

(Windows/Linux)
First install the main dependencies through pip:
```bash
# Install PyTorch-related core dependencies, skip if installed
# Reference: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio

#For Windows + Nvidia Ampere Architecture(RTX30xx), you need to specify the cuda version corresponding to pytorch according to the experience of https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI/issues/21
#pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117

#For Linux + AMD Cards, you need to use the following pytorch versions:
#pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm5.4.2
```

Then can use poetry to install the other dependencies:
```bash
# Install the Poetry dependency management tool, skip if installed
# Reference: https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

# Install the project dependencies
poetry install
```

You can also use pip to install them:
```bash

for Nvidia graphics cards
  pip install -r requirements.txt

for AMD/Intel graphics cards on Windows (DirectML)ï¼š
  pip install -r requirements-dml.txt

for Intel ARC graphics cards on Linux / WSL using Python 3.10: 
  pip install -r requirements-ipex.txt

for AMD graphics cards on Linux (ROCm):
  pip install -r requirements-amd.txt
```

------
Mac users can install dependencies via `run.sh`:
```bash
sh ./run.sh
```

## Preparation of other Pre-models
RVC requires other pre-models to infer and train.

You need to download them from our [Huggingface space](https://huggingface.co/lj1995/VoiceConversionWebUI/tree/main/).

Here's a list of Pre-models and other files that RVC needs:
```bash
./assets/hubert/hubert_base.pt

./assets/pretrained 

./assets/uvr5_weights

Additional downloads are required if you want to test the v2 version of the model.

./assets/pretrained_v2

If you want to test the v2 version model (the v2 version model has changed the input from the 256 dimensional feature of 9-layer Hubert+final_proj to the 768 dimensional feature of 12-layer Hubert, and has added 3 period discriminators), you will need to download additional features

./assets/pretrained_v2

#If you are using Windows, you may also need these two files, skip if FFmpeg and FFprobe are installed
ffmpeg.exe

https://huggingface.co/lj1995/VoiceConversionWebUI/blob/main/ffmpeg.exe

ffprobe.exe

https://huggingface.co/lj1995/VoiceConversionWebUI/blob/main/ffprobe.exe

If you want to use the latest SOTA RMVPE vocal pitch extraction algorithm, you need to download the RMVPE weights and place them in the RVC root directory

https://huggingface.co/lj1995/VoiceConversionWebUI/blob/main/rmvpe.pt

    For AMD/Intel graphics cards users you need download:

    https://huggingface.co/lj1995/VoiceConversionWebUI/blob/main/rmvpe.onnx

```

Intel ARC graphics cards users needs to run `source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh` command before starting Webui.

Then use this command to start Webui:
```bash
python infer-web.py
```

If you are using Windows or macOS, you can download and extract `RVC-beta.7z` to use RVC directly by using `go-web.bat` on windows or `sh ./run.sh` on macOS to start Webui.

## ROCm Support for AMD graphic cards (Linux only)
To use ROCm on Linux install all required drivers as described [here](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/deploy/linux/os-native/install.html).

On Arch use pacman to install the driver:
````
pacman -S rocm-hip-sdk rocm-opencl-sdk
````

You might also need to set these environment variables (e.g. on a RX6700XT):
````
export ROCM_PATH=/opt/rocm
export HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=10.3.0
````
Also make sure your user is part of the `render` and `video` group:
````
sudo usermod -aG render $USERNAME
sudo usermod -aG video $USERNAME
````
After that you can run the WebUI:
```bash
python infer-web.py
```
